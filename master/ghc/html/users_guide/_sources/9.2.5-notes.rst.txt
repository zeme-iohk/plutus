.. _release-9-2-5:

Version 9.2.5
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections.

The :ghc-flag:`LLVM backend <-fllvm>` of this release is to be used with LLVM
9, 10, 11, or 12.

Compiler
--------

- Fix a number of issues with the simplifier leading to core lint errors and suboptimal
  performance (:ghc-ticket:`21694`, :ghc-ticket:`21755`, :ghc-ticket:`22114`).

- Fix a sign extension bug resulting in incorrent runtime results on the native aarch64 backend (:ghc-ticket:`22282`).

- Improve determinism by not inclusing build directories in interface files (:ghc-ticket:`22162`).

- Fix a code generation panic when using SIMD types with unboxed sums (:ghc-ticket:`22187`).

- Fix a code generation bug with the native code generator on aarch64 darwin leading to runtime segmentation faults due to an incorrect ABI (:ghc-ticket:`21964`)

Runtime system
--------------

-  Fix a bug where attempting to clear the card table of a zero-length
   array resulted in an integer underflow (:ghc-ticket:`21962`).

Core libraries
--------------

- Bump ``base`` to 4.16.3.0.

- Bump ``process`` to 1.6.16.0

- base: Fix races in the IOManager to do with the ``setNumCapabilities`` and ``closeFdWith`` functions (:ghc-ticket:`21651`)
