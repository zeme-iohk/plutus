Overloaded string literals
--------------------------

.. extension:: OverloadedStrings
    :shortdesc: Enable overloaded string literals.

    :since: 6.8.1

    Enable overloaded string literals (e.g. string literals desugared via the
    ``IsString`` class).

GHC supports *overloaded string literals*. Normally a string literal has
type ``String``, but with overloaded string literals enabled (with
:extension:`OverloadedStrings`) a string literal has type
``(IsString a) => a``.

This means that the usual string syntax can be used, e.g., for
``ByteString``, ``Text``, and other variations of string like types.
String literals behave very much like integer literals, i.e., they can
be used in both expressions and patterns. If used in a pattern the
literal will be replaced by an equality test, in the same way as an
integer literal is.

The class ``IsString`` is defined as: ::

    class IsString a where
        fromString :: String -> a

The only predefined instance is the obvious one to make strings work as
usual: ::

    instance IsString [Char] where
        fromString cs = cs

The class ``IsString`` is not in scope by default. If you want to
mention it explicitly (for example, to give an instance declaration for
it), you can import it from module ``Data.String``.

Haskell's defaulting mechanism (`Haskell Report, Section
4.3.4 <http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.3.4>`__) is
extended to cover string literals, when :extension:`OverloadedStrings` is
specified. Specifically:

-  Each type in a ``default`` declaration must be an instance of ``Num``
   *or* of ``IsString``.

-  If no ``default`` declaration is given, then it is just as if the
   module contained the declaration
   ``default( Integer, Double, String)``.

-  The standard defaulting rule is extended thus: defaulting applies
   when all the unresolved constraints involve standard classes *or*
   ``IsString``; and at least one is a numeric class *or* ``IsString``.

So, for example, the expression ``length "foo"`` will give rise to an
ambiguous use of ``IsString a0`` which, because of the above rules, will
default to ``String``.

A small example:

::

    module Main where

    import Data.String( IsString(..) )

    newtype MyString = MyString String deriving (Eq, Show)
    instance IsString MyString where
        fromString = MyString

    greet :: MyString -> MyString
    greet "hello" = "world"
    greet other = other

    main = do
        print $ greet "hello"
        print $ greet "fool"

Note that deriving ``Eq`` is necessary for the pattern matching to work
since it gets translated into an equality comparison.
